Hello, this is me talking
Chicken little is not really a chicken, it is really just a chick.
But chick is just another way of describing an attractive lady
Chicken little is not an attractive lady
Hence, Chicken little is also not really a chick.
The question now is, is Chicken little, a chick or a chicken?
